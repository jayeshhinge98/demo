The "Default Company" button is a feature that works when you are viewing a Company record. By clicking this link, you are telling the system that you would like all views to default to this company, which can filter out information and only show information having to do with this particular record.
If you have a default company selected, the name of the company will show up on this button, and any subsequent records created will be made with this company information. Click this button from any screen to return to the default company record view. Click out of the company tab to clear this feature and default to viewing all information with no default company selected.
